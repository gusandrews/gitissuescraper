gitissuescraper
===============

A tool to help scrape not just the issues on a GitHub project, but also the comments and tags on each issue. 

Currently outputs issue title, issue body, issue URL, and tags in a four-column CSV for use in <a href="https://www.overviewproject.org/">Overview,</a> which allows for batch-tagging and visualization of common words.
